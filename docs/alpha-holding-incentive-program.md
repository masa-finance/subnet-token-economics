2. Stake at least one Masa Subnet Alpha Token (Subnet 42 and/or Subnet 59)

## How to Maximize Your Rewards

### 1. Stake Masa's Subnet Alpha Tokens

#### Obtaining Alpha Tokens
You can obtain Alpha Tokens by:
- Earning as a miner or validator on Masa's Subnets 42 and 59
- Staking TAO to Masa's Subnets to receive Alpha Tokens

#### Holding Requirements
- Maintain alpha token emissions for 120 days
- Keep 100% of alpha tokens during the reward period (no unstaking)
- Maintain complete alpha holdings (any sales disqualify the hotkey)
- Keep tokens in original hotkey (transfers result in reward exclusion)

### 2. Delegate Alpha Tokens
Delegate your alpha tokens to Masa's validators:
- Subnet 42: UID 29 Hotkey: 5ChhHEqBdPm5St9kwndwdP8Y1bXWZc14XabDUJLtgGFiZuHV
- Subnet 59: UID 10 Hotkey: 5CZv4oXgYsAFjJj8rLmmbLG29y7x9RGEc6hM9tzCwRU8NeDe

> Note: Subnet Alpha Token staking is open to all participants including TAO stakers, subnet miners, and validators. Earlier participation leads to higher rewards.
